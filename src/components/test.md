**give a man a fish…**

*"How did you get here again? The base is surrounded by armed personnel."*

*"Happy birthday, mama."*

*"Thank you, Mirek."*

*"I wanted to give you your present first. So I can win my bet with Glorija."*

*"And so the power of filial love and sibling rivalry allowed you into high-security non-civilian territory?" She raised an eyebrow. "Perhaps I should have some words with some colleagues of mine."*

*"A-also, there is a hole in the fence about 200m from the north of the grounds..."*

*"And the dogs?"*

*"...Are susceptible to chunks of muffins laced with sleeping medication..."*

*"And my colleagues who are stationed outside the door of this building?"*

*"...even windows on the top floor shouldn't be left open."*

*"Impressive." Mama swept his hair to one side. "How did you find my locker key?"*

*"I didn't. I picked it."*

*"Clever boy." She reached past him to take her bag from the back, then pushed him out of the locker. "Come on. Before I go home without you."*

*Mirek stepped out, then offered his wrapped box to her.*

*"Thank you."*

*"I'm sorry I'm not old enough to work like Glorija, and I don't cry all the time like Dasha-"*

*"That&#x20;*&#x69;s *a good thing. She is 5 - you are not."*

*"-But I didn't steal this time. I used my pocket money for it."*

*"Good boy." Mama had ripped open the wrapping paper with one nail - almost surgical precision - and slipped the sweets box beneath out from its cover.*

*Her face as composed as ever, she uttered tenderly, "My favourite."*

*Has it been exactly ten years? Almost.*

“*We are now approaching District 6 west station. Change here for the Tidebreaker line towards District 6 east, or towards District 19.*”

Mirek slipped the sweets box back into his bag, reciting the contents of the list he’d forgotten to bring.\
*Fish. Fish for soup. Rice. Um…*\
“*We have arrived at District 6 west station. All change.*”

He grabbed his bag and broke into a leisurely jog. It wasn’t long before the sprawling greenery and farms below had given way to a vast expanse of water stretching into the horizon.

That’&#x73;*&#x20;the ocean? It’s sparkling in the sun. As exquisite as I’ve heard it to be.*

*“We have arrived at District 18 south station.”\
Already?*

Staving off his premature heart attack, Mirek stepped onto the platform and took his first gulp of the chilled, salty breeze. The height of the station, and its closeness to the ocean itself, made for a view that was as blue as the eye could see. Sand was commonplace for everyone, but along the shore, it was an uncharacteristically white shade, with tourists frolicking along it amidst market stands and tents.

*Look for the fishers’ market*, Mirek said to himself, knowing damn well he was about to go wandering and completely forget about his errands for at least the next few hours.\
Indeed, no better than a tourist. Who could blame him, when the stalls were so bright – fashioned in dazzling reds and golds, banners and lines of lanterns dancing like flames in the wind – and smells of all sorts wafting through the bustling streets.

*So many lanterns. This place must look divine at night time.*

He found a giant tree whose branches of pink petals were decorated with tied red ribbons, and a food market stretched what must have been half the coastline until he found a break in the line and made his way towards the beach.

The sand was luxuriously soft – not the harsh, rock-laden stuff that was outside the border. Kicking up a bit of it, Mirek found himself a mottled, hole-ridden seashell and tried to crush it in his palm.

*Nice. Stronger than you look.*

He was about to toss it into the ocean when he realised the sky had begun to turn orange. With his realisation turning into annoyance and a very vague sense of panic, he ventured back to the stone front and followed the route along in a random direction.

*I was supposed to get stuff done today. How come the day flies so fast?*

Mirek came to a stop.

*I&#x20;*&#x64;id *want to see the night markets.*

So he sat down and watched the sky’s flaming colours die down into the night before he made his way back into the streets.

Lanterns glowing in the low hubbub between sizzles and chatter. Without the overwhelming drone of a crowd, he could hear the lantern-bells chiming as they swayed along in the cold wind. Sweet, seasoned meat wafting from every direction he turned…

*Work has been slow lately in District 1. Maybe I could move here?\
No – what a silly thought. Nobody needs a mercenary in a touristy area like this.*

Finding a break in the stalls, Mirek once again made a beeline for the edge of the ocean, gravitating towards a nearby pier. Right – it had begun to glow.

*All this and you couldn’t find the fish stall. Mama, your fish solyanka can wait for a day.*

Mirek watched as the luminous blue waves rhythmically rolled onto and receded from the shore. In and out, like the ocean’s breath. In the corner of his eye, something further out on the water broke through the glow of the waves – a small boat, likely – and made its way towards the pier.

Calmly, Mirek stood and walked further in, intending to sit on the edge and obscure himself with some of the empty crates to avoid a conversation. Through cautious glances back, he watched the boat bring itself in, and its single passenger hauled themself out with a few ragged gasps.

He was taking very ragged, almost laboured breaths - the type one would take after having run a marathon. Was rowing really that hard?

The person walked down the pier, stopping about where Mirek was sitting. *Wait – was I spotted? Is this an ambush?*

His grip tightened on the sheathed weapon at his belt – a non-etherium knife, albeit technically illegal to carry with intent to use, but he preferred the risk if he could rely on its tangible sharpness – ready to strike without the need to alter energy modes.

But of course, it was only the shipping crate the stranger needed, and he went back, taking with him the scent of sweat and sea salt.

Hauling it back along to the boat, the person unloaded something into the crate, then started to carry it back down the pier. Slowly.

*Boat… crate. That’s got to be a fisherman coming in with a catch.*

The crate dropped. He let out a wince – injured, from the sounds of it – still struggling for breath as something else dropped.

And then nothing for a while except the sound of breathing.

Mirek gazed into the glowing ocean and grimaced.

*I’m armed. If I’m found here, I’m instantly suspicious. Same goes if I hand him in. I don’t have to be a hero today – no one’s holding me accountable.*

*Still - I might be able to score a free fish or two from this little encounter.*

His light steps across the pier were still audible, though barely. The crate was lined with a net that was full of a fish that also carried a faint glow - though maybe that was just that they were coated in the glowing ocean water.

He crouched to inspect the catch, grabbing one as it squirmed.

“M-mostly… glassfins – in there,” the figure managed from his foetal position.

“What do you care?” Mirek said. “ Go back to dying, or something.”

“…Haha. You’re funny. Well, my aunt is expecting the next haul by 3am, so…”

“Something tells me you’re not making the deadline.” Tossing the fish back into the crate, Mirek stepped forward to catch a better glimpse of him, though he couldn’t make out much in the dark - only that he sounded quite young, and had long dark hair.

“Th-there’s a leeway of… one hour, we… get early customers at four, so that’s… half hour to… half…” he laughed again – nervously. “ Tourists are never… out this late.”

“Who says I’m a tourist?”

“Accent…”

“Touche. Why does the water glow?”

“Bioluminescent… plankton. Lots of them.”

“Is it *that* dangerous?”

“N-not at all. I had a run-in with a… shoal of sharpfish, so they… had a little play. With me.”

“Sounds terrible. Get well soon,” Mirek said flatly. He grabbed a pale fish from the crate.“ Can I take this?”

The young man laughed shakily.

“That’s not a no.” Fish in hand, Mirek made his way back over the beach.

*This thing’s slimy. Maybe I should ask for some paper or a bag. Hell, if I can be bothered, I can worm around for his family, then charge a retrieval fee - or something.*

Mirek wasn’t sure he’d ever eaten glassfin before. He’d certainly never seen it like this - in the light of the lanterns, it was as if its very skin was slightly translucent.

No - its flesh didn’t look familiar at all. Mirek wasn’t sure if it would taste good in a soup.

*I’d better get an exchange.*

With the fish still writhing in his hand, he went all the way back and looked through the crate again.

“You said mostly. What else is in here?”

No answer.

“Did you pass out or are you just ignoring me?”

Nothing.

*Guess I’ll just… go somewhere else. Not like I was paying him, anyway.*

*Whoo - if Dasha or Glorija could see me right now, they’d beat my ass. But I’m not on the clock, so never do a thing for free. So…*

He made the mistake of looking back at the man curled up on the pier. Next thing he knew, he was carrying the unconscious stranger on his back.

*Where do I even leave him? How much do I charge for a ransom?*

Finally approaching the stretch just below the market street, he let the man down on the stone steps and took a breather. In the new light, the extent of his injuries were pretty severe, to the point where Mirek realised that the wet on his back was probably blood and not just seawater. With a mean puncture to the gut that may have once been washed out but had since bled back into his wet tunic, the man must have still been suffering some kind of sea delusion if he thought he could still make the 3pm deadline in his condition.

“I guess this is a sick day whether you like it or not,” Mirek muttered, hauling him back onto his back.

He asked the first vendor he saw for directions to a “hotel or hospital or something.”

“Is that Asaba? Tsukaji’s kid?”

“Don’t know, don’t care, but he got stabbed up by a sharpfish or something if that’s important to you.”

“Uh – right, emergency room is– here, follow me, okay?”

“No. I’m not a family member. I’m not even a friend.”

“He’ll need someone to take him home when he gets out of surgery.”

“You can access his records. Call his aunt, or something.”

After a moment of hesitation, the nurse nodded. “Thank you for all your help.”

*3am. If I wait a little while for the markets to open, maybe I can catch an early bird sale on fish?*

*That vendor identified him a little too easily. Is he famous around here? Could I not get a - saviour’s discount, or something?*

Mirek shivered at himself.

*Never mind. That doesn’t suit you at all. Ew.*

# []()Asaba (2)

“Time to go, child.”

Asaba woke up with a start.

“Today’s haul is-”

“Rotting on the pier where you left it.”

“I-I’m sorry, Aunt Hifumi,” Asaba stammered. “It-it won’t- I’ll do better next time!”

“Doesn’t it hurt?” she replied, pursing her lips. “To get so flustered with a hole in your stomach, barely patched.”

Asaba finally slowed down to appreciate the dull throbbing of his entire torso. With his hand bandaged and now dripless, the painkiller - and the anaesthetic - would soon wear off. And he was *not* looking forward to it.

“Who’s going to handle- everything?”

“Kayoko is old enough. She’ll learn the ropes quickly.”

“She has school!”\
“So did you, at that age. No – you were working for me even younger - we had to convince you to *stay* in school, didn’t we?”

“But the reason I did that was so they… wouldn’t have to.”

“Don’t jump to conclusions, little one,” Hifumi sighed. “The stall can take a break for a while. Besides, it’s not a death sentence for Kayo, or for you. At times, it sounds like I’m keeping you like a slave…”

“Not at all. I love this work.” Asaba looked her in the eye. “Every time I go out and the ocean glows… and- under the water was… so pretty. But it was so cold, I…”

“...Didn’t see the sharpfish?”

“A-ah– who told you?”

“Shufen. The vendor - she does those fritters you like. But she didn’t find or carry you, though - some foreign man did that.”

“With that northwestern accent?” Asaba’s eyes widened. “Is he from District 1, or 2…?”

“I don’t know. He left quickly.”

“He wanted to buy fish! And know about the ocean. I should- we should-”

“Go home?” Hifumi offered.

Asaba relented, nodding slowly.

The glowing plankton had lost its sheen long before the sunrise.

Mirek had never seen so much sky before. The walls, especially on the city’s borders, normally cut the view off. Yet here, he could see the sky set itself alight with no intrusion.

The tied-up fishing boat bobbed silently. And the crate of fish - now lifeless, and almost ominously so, had Mirek not already become accustomed to the quietness of death - was exactly where it was dropped.

*I should leave before someone arrives to retrieve it.*

But something about the view was magnetic. The sun hadn’t yet ascended fully, and as such had painted the horizon a striking shade of orange that wouldn’t look out of place in the markets.

“Oh, thank… Eterna.”

*Damn.*

Mirek didn’t want to glance back at the familiar voice and set of footsteps – two sets, one faster than the other – sounding up the pier.

“*Asaba,*” said a mature woman’s voice – a warning.

“No– it’s okay, I promise!”

“You’d better not be arguing over who carries the crate back,” Mirek muttered, not looking at them.

The faster set of footsteps came up to the edge of the pier and stopped next to him.

“It *is* you. Were you looking after the fish crate for me?”

“Nonsense. I haven’t looked at that thing in hours.”

“Whatever. You carried me back, didn’t you? I need to thank you properly.”

Mirek sighed loudly. “And if that wasn’t me?”

“I know it was you. I had a feeling you were kinder than you-”

“Whatever helps you sleep at night.” Mirek pulled himself off the pier’s edge and stood before him – almost towering over him. “Get on with it, then.”

“I am indebted to you,” the man said with a slight, strained bow. “My name is Asaba Tsukaji, by the way. What’s yours?”

“Not important.”

“Weird name. Your parents hated you that much?”

“Maybe a little,” Mirek swallowed. “You call me Miroslav, if you must. But I’ll be going now.”

“A-ah… wait – didn’t you want–” Asaba stammered after him. “Didn’t you want – the glassfin, or – can’t we treat you to dinner?”

Mirek stopped walking to consider it. The lady that had accompanied Asaba was one of perfect poise and posture; although the way she spoke indicated a middle or older age, her face was pristine. Unsmiling.

“Stay for a meal,” she said. Something about the instruction was tender, but not in a way that made Mirek feel comfortable.

“It would be an honour, then,” he said after some hesitation, bowing his head.

Asaba winced behind him.

He clearly tried to bend down and felt the aftershocks of his injuries, from the way he was clasping his torso.

“Really?” Mirek said, lifting the crate instead with ease. “Stand up. You’ll have to walk by yourself this time.”

“Please don’t bother yourself,” the lady said, moving forward to take it from him. But he didn’t offer it.

“Let me, at least.”

“You *are* a gentleman,” the lady commented. “My nephew and I are extremely grateful for all your help.”

# []()Asaba (4)

Aunt Hifumi insisted she prepare the food alone. But that left him and Miroslav eyeing each other up at opposite ends of the table.

His gaze was severe, like Aunt Hifumi’s – one that pierced through your soul and left fear spilling out into your bones – but also a little tired. After a while, he stood and gazed out of the window, inspected the walls and the doors’ sliding mechanisms, before eventually observing Aunt Hifumi’s cooking.

“Is that glassfin.”

“Yes. Though not from last night’s catch.”

“We’re lucky we got it to the freezer before it spoiled…” Asaba sighed with a sheepish smile plastered along his face when he remembered the struggle to retain the net’s contents after his boat had tipped. He’d been in such a state, he hadn’t had time to sort anything - only grabbing the net and rowing his way back to land.

“Is it still glowing.”

“Yes. That is safe, don’t worry.”

“Does it stop glowing when you cook it?”

“Yes. Though this one has been blast-frozen and thawed, so we will be eating it raw.”

Miroslav pursed his lips.

“*Raw.*”

“With rice, today.”

“...I forgot… to get rice.”

“You need rice?” Asaba piped up. “Take some – we have loads!” He stood, taking some paper bags from the kitchen cabinet beside Aunt Hifumi before cracking open the rice box and shovelling some into a bag.

Kayoko and Mitsuko creaked slowly down the stairs, with Kayo peering curiously around the corner into the kitchen.

“You’re up early for once,” Asaba grinned. “We have a guest today, okay? Kayoko, Mitsuko – this is Mr Miroslav.”

“...Heard you from upstairs,” Kayoko said quietly. Mitsuko peeked out from behind her and waved.

…His steely expression unwavering, Miroslav waved back.

Asaba layered the rice bag and sealed it tightly with string as Aunt Hifumi served up two small bowls of rice and omelette, which Kayoko and Mitsuko gratefully took to the table and began to wolf down.

“Glassfin for lunch?” Mitsuko asked. Aunt Hifumi nodded.

“Glow-y su-shi!” the two began to chant in reply.

“You finished your homework last night, right?” Asaba asked, kneeling beside their bags by the wall. The two nodded.

“Kayo, please finish your homework early today. You will be taking over Asaba’s fishing shift tonight,” Aunt Hifumi added.

Kayoko nodded sagely, but Mitsuko looked at Asaba wide-eyed. “Why? Are you okay?”

He nodded quickly. “We decided Kayoko needs some more practice, that’s all!”

Miroslav had opened his mouth to speak. Asaba shot him a look to shut him up, but he went ahead and spoke anyway-

“Miss Kayoko, do you have a favourite type of fish?” he asked.

*Not what I expected at all. Phew.*

“Uh…” Kayoko finished her mouthful. “Everyone loves glassfin tiras because they’re a little clear. But I also like…” She gestured a small length with her fingers. “Sunscale darters. Have you heard of them?”

“I haven’t.” Miroslav crouched to her level. “That small?”

“And they have a rainbow line on their bodies.”

“And they’re crunchy!” Mitsuko chimed in.

“Right - we fry them with salt,” Asaba clarified. “As, like, a snack. Here - wait, we might have some.” He cracked open a tub from the fridge and grabbed a pair of chopsticks, placing a couple in each bowl, and then offering one to Miroslav. “*Salty~~~*”

…And Miroslav took it by the fingers and ate it without batting an eyelid, or crumpling at the taste.

*You’re a stronger man than me. Without rice, too…*

“Is it good, Mr Miroslav?” Kayoko asked.

He nodded.

After finishing their breakfasts and packing their lunchboxes, Kayo and Mimi went off to school, and Aunt Hifumi laid plates of immaculately-formed sushi out for the three of them, along with three pairs of chopsticks.

“Do you know how to use them?” Asaba asked cheerily, moving to sit next to him. “Here-”

Miroslav stared him dead in the eye.

“Hold yours.”

Asaba dutifully obeyed, secretly hoping he wouldn’t die from such a menacing look.

Miroslav copied his stance, then tested it out – picking at the sushi almost effortlessly on the first try.

“Ahhh… how…” Asaba kept smiling. “Not that I… had any doubt, haha!”

“I learn fast,” Miroslav said flatly. He seemed to have caught Asaba staring, because he added quietly, “I taught myself to pick locks, braid ropes, fix my own clothes… I’ve had practice.”

“*None of that is the same thing,”&#x20;*&#x41;saba mumbled in an equally quiet voice.

“How is the sushi?” Aunt Hifumi asked.

Miroslav nodded again. “Also good.”

“If you’re not a fussy eater, you can say so,” Asaba said jokingly.

“I am not. But I’ meat. It was a luxury for us. Fish especially.” He had a hand on his bag - the one that he had stored the bag of rice in - as he stared at the plate and continued quietly, “I wanted to make a fish soup for my mother’s birthday today. But it wasn’t glassfin I was after - or even sunscale darter.”

“Soup?” Asaba mused. “Do you use, maybe… emberback skale? No? Rocksmaw? It’s dark coloured, brown, a little flat… no? Or kellbass?”

“That one,” Miroslav said. “Bass.”

“We tend to sell out of that pretty fast, but maybe our freezer has some spare?”

“Let me check.” Having finished her portion, Aunt Hifumi placed her chopsticks down and headed out to the back, leaving the two to eat in a silence that was somehow even emptier than before.

Or maybe not. Maybe it was Asaba’s heart beating a little faster. He swallowed it and attempted, “Thank you again for… last night,” but to no response. “You - have to get back to your mother, right? At least let me walk you to the station.”

“Fine,” Miroslav replied, “But with one detour.”

“Anywhere.”

“Black market.”\
“Anywhere *but that*.”

Miroslav turned to look at him with genuine curiosity in his dead-looking eyes. “Why?”

“It’s - y’know - *illegal*.”

“And yet it exists.” Miroslav pinched his chopsticks together, over and over, as he spoke. “I know District 18’s is one of the largest - so formidable, the authorities couldn’t shut it down even if they tried. So I want to see it – call it research.”

“Your curiosity *will* get you killed like this.”

“Part of the job.”

“Huh?”

“The line of work I’m in, this kind of knowledge would be useful. That’s all.”

“And I’m guessing if I ask any further, you’d have to kill me?”

“It wouldn’t be too difficult at this point in time, would it?”

“...A valid point.” Asaba sighed. “Fine, okay? Only because I owe you. We’d better be even after this.”

“We will be.”

Aunt Hifumi returned with a chunk of thoroughly frozen kellbass and wrapped it well.

# []()Miroslav (5)

Asaba walked around looking a little lost, scouting out sewer grates and inspecting them until he found one - around the corner from the large, pink, ribbon-adorned tree - and declared, “Here.”

“You think it’s an entrance?”

“The official seal is normally engraved in the corner. There’s nothing here, you see?”

“Fine.” Mirek lifted the grate with relative ease and began to make his way down the ladder. Asaba tried to follow suit, wincing as he crouched.

“Should you be doing that?” Mirek asked, loading his voice with a judgemental edge.

“A guide can’t leave you hanging halfway,” Asaba said, attempting a proud huff. “It’s not safe to go alone.”

“And?”

“What do you mean, *and*?” Closing the grate behind them, Asaba made his way to the bottom.

It had suddenly become much more difficult to breathe: the place reeked of rust and damp. Iron scaffolding overhead seemed barely stable and the curved stone walls were covered in etchings into the moss and slime.

“Don’t tell Aunt Hifumi I know about this, by the way.”\
“Why would I- how *do* you know about this place, then?”

“Uh, I- ah- sometimes, as a fisherman, you find certain species that, uh… well, it-it’s just something yo&#x75;*&#x20;know*, okay? It’s just no&#x74;*&#x20;good* to know.” Asaba recoiled in on himself, as if he regretted opening his mouth at all, then led the way down one side of the tunnel, hand outstretched as if to trace the scratchings - but he never quite touched them.

The road ahead took a steep drop, but Asaba made a turn and took the narrow, moss-coated footpath along a wall that overlooked a long, empty hall built into the stone.

And then he suddenly came to a stop. Just in front, he’d caught sight of two figures dressed in dark clothing.

Miroslav overhead them mumbling to themselves, something along the lines of,

“That one is definitely a tourist,“ and, “I don’t think they have much, but it’s been a long while, so…”

“Do- do you want us to move?” Asaba began. “Sorry… let’s just… back up.”

That was before the second figure drew an etherium blade, its sickly blue glow illuminating the inky black as Asaba backed away hastily.

“You’re gonna hand over all your valuables,” the figure in front said. “Starting with your bank cards.”

“There are black market vendors who mod etherium tech,” Asaba said under his breath. “No biorecognition filters - we’ll be sliced and diced like sushi if that’s one of them.”

Mirek pulled Asaba back a little faster, so that they were off the narrow, slippery footpath and back in the tunnel they’d come from. Once on solid ground, Asaba stayed between Mirek and the thieves, shakily reaching into his belt bag and pulling out what seemed to be a small fillet knife.

“What’s that gonna do?” The first figure mocked, also withdrawing an etherium blade of her own. “Gonna poke us to death? Save yourself the hassle.”

“If it can gut fish, it can gut you,” Asaba said, holding it in front of him and angling himself as if to shield Mirek from the fray.

*Cute. Kind of pathetic, though. He’s shaking. He doesn’t know how to use that thing - and he doesn’t want to.*

*If you want a job done, do it yourself.*

“No,” Mirek sighed, stepping past him and slipping the knife out of Asaba’s hands. “He’s right. You just need enough force, though. Now scram or I’ll turn *you* into human sushi.”

“Don’t make me laugh.” The second thief - the first to draw his weapon - stepped past his companion and darted forward with the intention of doing at least a little damage - but his moves were sloppy, Slow. Untrained.

So Mirek stepped out of the way easily and threw the fillet knife at his chest.

“Tsk. Missed,” he muttered, watching the knife embed itself into the thief’s lower ribcage instead. The glowing blade deactivated automatically as he dropped it and screamed, so Mirek pulled it towards him with his boot, kicked it up into his hands and reached forward to retrieve the knife, cleaning the bloodied blade on his trouser leg.

“That’s- illegal,” The first thief stammered, holding her still-screaming companion in horror. “You can’t just carry real blades and use them to hurt people-”

“How *terrible*.” Mirek waved the hilt of the dropped blade at them. “Ignoring the attempted theft, of course - Shall the test the legality of your etherium weapons? Tell me, which is your least favourite leg?”

With a whimper, she began to drag her companion away, back down the narrow walkway. Mirek watched them reach halfway, then turned back to return Asaba’s knife.

“Disinfect before use.”

“Y-yeah… uh- what-what do you work as, again?”

“Mercenary.” Mirek flipped the etherium hilt around in his hands, then offered it forward. “I don’t suppose you want this?”

“Mercenar- Keep that fifteen feet away from me, please.”

“Whatever you say.”

Mirek tossed the hilt far into the abyss, then gestured to Asaba to lead the way again.

# []()Asaba (6)

*I knew he would be strong from that physique, but- what if he turns on me?*

It was lucky there was only one path, because Asaba couldn’t stop the worries from spiralling.

*I don’t stand a chance. He could disarm me in an instant. He’s done this a million times before. He could crush me if he wanted to. I don’t think I could even run. I couldn’t- ahhh…!*

Asaba shuddered at the hand on his arm - but Miroslav’s grip was gentle.

“You’re swaying,” he said from behind. “Do you need to go back?”

“N-no. No, it’s not too long now, anyway.”

The path veered down and curved around, eventually opening up into a wide cavern steeped in water.

In the gloom, piers and ocean were barely distinguishable save for the incandescence of various lanterns, both flame and bioluminescent, strung and tangled between the kelp netting above. Two main walkways, clustered to both long sides of the cavern, were well populated with wooden stalls and small boats flitting between.

Miroslav looked entranced, and began to walk towards the closest walkway.

“Wait- wait, you’re not gonna- *browse*?!”

“What else is there to do?” he remarked. “What’s… that?” He pointed to one of the water-lanterns containing several glowing, red-tinted jellyfish crammed into the small space.

“Off to a great start,” Asaba muttered. “They’re crimson seafoam jellyfish - a delicacy, but the outer skin has a really nasty toxin. Banned thanks to all the deaths due to improper preparation.”

Eyes wide, Miroslav nodded. He walked a little further and pointed to a tank with two delicate-looking crabs.

“Isn’t it pretty? Pink and white - that’s gotta be the kumori crab. I’m pretty sure they’re endangered - and they’re tough to catch, too, since those thin little pincers can still pack a punch.”

“Looks like the trees…”

“Right?”

Miroslav looked at Asaba, looking a little less dead than usual - genuinely curious, from the looks of it.

*He looks like he’s having fun.&#x20;*&#x41;saba couldn’t help but smile wistfully as he followed after him, butterflies dancing in the pit of his stomach.

“That…”

“I think that’s a piranite. Can you see his stomach? Kinda green? So, corrosaw piranite - they’re kinda rare in these parts, but that’s a good thing. They come in huge swarms with rows of tiny saw-like teeth. And stomach acid that can corrode bone.”

“They’re so *small*.”

“Think, one hundred sets of tiny teeth…”

“...Point taken. Oh - oyster shells? They’re beautiful.”

“Yeah, moonmaidens oyster shell jewellery isn’t illegal *per se*, but selling the creature itself *is*. There, see - over there? In the tank, with the pink fleshy things. That’s the oyster.”

“Why’s it illegal?”

“Psychotrophic *and* addictive. Drugs from the ocean, basically.”

Miroslav reached to touch one of the dangling earrings made of pearlescent midnight shell shards, but Asaba grabbed him before he could.

“‘Don’t touch until it’s yours’ is a good rule to live by.”

“Right.”

They passed another shop that used water-lanterns, this time with pearlescent white dreamshore jellyfish – “Those are hallucinogenic as well - but really popular just as pets, because their stings are mostly harmless and the babies start off really small, like that.” - before reaching the fighting rings further down.

In a larger tank, an octopus was lying in wait, attempting to blend into the dead coral and kelp that it was lying against.

“That octopus tends to be put in fights against others of the same species, because they turn their pigmentation all colourful.”

“What are they called?”

“Echoslight octopus. …Oh, that’s because they use a form of echolocation to hunt prey.”

“Wait, over there. Their fins are so elegant - aren’t they fighting?”

“Yeah - gammafish fighting is one of the biggest money makers down here, I think. But if we wait for a bit - yeah, there we go - see the purple light bar? They’re gonna turn it on, so you can see the UV markings on their fins.”

“You know so much about… everything.”

“Obviously. I’ve been fishing since I was 12.”

“When I was 12, I was breaking into military bases. Only the one my mama worked in, though.”

“Yeah, that… that makes it fine, then…” Asaba felt the chills run down his spine again. Though maybe that was also thanks to the fact they’d been here *long enough*.

*It’s only a matter of time until something bad happens - again. Even though Miroslav will be fine, I… I’m not in any shape to be dealing with it right now.*

“Let’s go back now,” Asaba laughed nervously.

“I want to see the other side,” Miroslav insisted.

“It’s nothing but the same old junk. C’mon, let’s go.”

“If you’re scared, don’t be. You know I can-”

“Yeah, sure, whatever. Let’s just go.”

“*You* can head back. I’ll explore alone,” Miroslav said curtly. He furrowed his eyebrows, growing annoyed by the second.

“You’d better not be asking random vendors all you&#x72;*&#x20;questions,*” Asaba hit back. He lowered his tone to hiss, “You can’t trust them.”

“You think I don’t know that? I’m not stupid and naive like you.”

“Remember, you don’t *live here*,” Asaba retaliated. “You wouldn’t last the day without me. –Where are you going?”

“To last the day without you.” Miroslav didn’t even bother looking back as he spoke.

Just like on the pier.

*Selfish, stubborn, self-centered-*

Asaba felt his blood boiling, but he took a slow, deep breath of the air - the rotting seaweed, damp wood and fish guts.

“Go ahead and die, then,” he muttered to himself, turning the other way. “I fulfilled my promise.” The pit of his stomach was churning - afraid - but of course it was. He didn’t come down here anymore for a reason.

*I bet all that trivia got to your head. Fine by me - I’m not the one who was in a surgery room this morning. If anything happens, I’ll be fine. I don’t need you anymore.*

The other side of the market seemed to be an eclectic mix of the same types of sea creatures - monstrously large fish, spiked fish, eels and slimy worm-like things - as well as herbs, plants, mysterious vials and even technology. Mirek passed one stall with motherboards and drive fragments in its display case counter, with its shopkeep dissecting what appeared to be a battered etherium hilt.

*Ah… is that the one I threw? Maybe not. Still, I should have kept it. Maybe I could have sold it here.*

“I do modifications too,” the vendor said, her gaze locked on the hardware. One eye was covered with an eyepatch, but it didn’t stop her from wearing welding shades.

“Oh - he only uses *real* blades,” said a voice from the other side of the market. The unharmed thief from earlier sat sprawled across the bench. Behind her, her companion was being tended to by a dishevelled medic.

“It wasn’t *mine*,” Mirek sighed, turning to her with his arms crossed. “If you aren’t prepared to deal with the consequences, then maybe you shouldn’t be robbing people.”

“...What a stroke of luck.” The technology shopkeeper put the broken hilt down and picked up another one from beside her - far more shiny and new, clearly customised. “Sorry, stranger, but I’m duty-bound to protect the honour of my family. So I might need to teach you a lesson.”

“Get him, Fang!” said the injured thief.

As she stepped around her stall, Mirek rolled his eyes, hand on the hilt of his own blade. “Do you really start fights in the middle of a market? Because I defended myself?”

A noticeable space around them had formed, with the crowd going about their business around it as if it was a commonplace occurrence, and nothing more than another public nuisance that didn’t deserve attention.

“Not if I can help it. But often enough.” Her etherium blade glowed bright and green - crackling and humming with a ferocity Mirek had never seen before. *Definitely* not above-board.

Fang held herself with the stance of an executioner, straight-backed and poised for a lethal counterattack. Mirek would almost certainly lose a limb if he took her head-on. He was just about to unsheathe his blade when footsteps hurried down the hollow wood and a familiar voice, out-of-breath from the sprint, managed, “Wait- wait, Mx Spadavo, you’ve got it wrong.”

“*No* - it was *definitely* those two!” the thief on the bench interrupted, leaning forward and pointing an accusing finger at Asaba. “*He’s* the one with the knife, too!”

“No-nono, I mean- we’re here to *buy*,” Asaba mumbled a little guiltily. He braced a hand on Mirek’s, pushing down as if to stop him from drawing his weapon. “Provided a purchase still gets us a SpadaVault membership…”

Retracting their green blade, Fang Spadavo shrugged and returned to being behind their stall. “It still does. Take your pick.”

There were mutters of outrage from behind them, to which Fang replied coolly, “You’re taking the risk of harm by buying from me. So make sure you’re ready to *deal with the consequences.*”

*Modified, full capability (biorecognition bypass) - B grade - dagger, 8 inches. Red.&#x20;*&#x4D;irek picked it out hastily, looking only at the price. He reached for his card, but Asaba got there first.

“I can pay for my own-”\
“Trust me, *darling,*” Asaba purred. He angled his card a little towards Mirek, just enough for him to catch a glimpse of its logo - a bank he’d never seen before.

“Shared membership is for legal partners,” Fang said, searching for something in her drawers.

“That’s the one.”

Mirek was about to protest when Asaba nestled his head a little closer into his shoulder.

*No, wait. This is part of your plan.*

Mirek took a few slow breaths of the putrid saltwater, damp wood and surgical spirit in the air as Asaba lifted his head and used the cardreader, leaving his shoulder a little cold.

“Just enter your contact details there.”

*…Why do I feel so strange? I’m not normally so averse to being touched. It’s probably just because he was so close.*

“All done. I’ll send your receipt there, too.” Fang produced a business card and offered it to Mirek. “Remember, you get access to member discounts and the exclusive bounty board. Welcome to the family.”

Mirek shot Asaba a glance, but received nothing but a knowing smile.

“You owe me~~~,” Asaba hummed, leading him down the market by the arm - towards the section Mirek hadn’t seen yet.

“I do. I’ll pay you back.”

In amongst the various wares, Mirek caught sight of some small translucent creatures, with cores glowing various shades of pastel pink, inside a water-filled lantern. He pointed and without missing a beat, Asaba said, “Candy sea angels. They’re sea slugs and they use that glow to hunt. Though, I think they’re bred for food down here.”

“For sweets?”

“Yes, actually. They’re meant to be sugary and a little chewy when dried out.”

“Maybe my sisters would like a try.”

“Please no.”

“You’re right. I have some sweets in my bag, anyway.”

“For your mother’s birthday? Shouldn’t you be getting back?” Asaba asked.

“Mmm.” Mirek went quiet, trying to work out what was making him feel so strange. After a little while, he finally found the words. “I apologise for my attitude. Thank you for coming back for me.”

“I told you you wouldn’t survive.” Asaba let out a small laugh. “No, but - I didn’t mean it like that. I’m sorry as well - I think I got a bit defensive, because - I’m not used to being… looked after, I guess…?” He coughed slightly, adding quietly, “You saved my life back there and I didn’t even thank you…”

“Not being looked after? …That makes sense. Me, too, in a way.” Mirek shrugged. “Kayoko and Mitsuko are your little sisters, right?”

“Yeah. I love them to bits. Are your sisters all younger, too?”

“Dasha is much younger than me, but Glorija is older. I’m a middle child, so I…”

*Got left out a lot. Spent my childhood roaming the streets for something to do, getting into trouble just to have Mama talk to me…*

*She was so busy back then, and I shouldn’t have done all that.*

*I suppose it’s water under the bridge now.*

“That must be rough. I know I felt a little left out when Kayoko came along, but… I’m so much older now that I feel like a parent to them, ahaha…” Asaba chuckled, hand creeping behind Mirek’s back. “I’m getting distracted. C’mon, is there anything else you want to see?”

Mirek had found himself caught up in the features of Asaba’s face.

“No. I’m ready to leave now.”

“Alright, let’s go out this way.” Asaba took a turn into one of the tunnels bored into the rocky wall.

“If anything happens-”

“-And it won’t.”

“-But just in case - don’t use yourself as a human meat shield for me again. Not only are *you* injured, but for me - I’m a mercenary, remember? Death comes as part of the job description.”

Asaba stopped suddenly, hesitating to speak. He swallowed, then muttered shadily, “Ehh, no promises.”

# []()Asaba (8)

There was another narrow walkway waiting for them at the end of the tunnel. Illuminated sparsely with lanterns, it somehow felt even worse than before, with jagged rocks poking out of the wall and patches of wood crudely nailed into the ground to cover parts where the walkway had crumbled.

Leading the way, Asaba stuck as close to the wall as he could, lightly holding the nooks for support. He tested each step first before committing to it.

“I don’t think the rock is stable,” Asaba muttered.

Miroslav mumbled an affirmation.

“Should we go back?”

“We’re nearly halfway.” Miroslav paused. “What do you think?”

“...Mmm, we can make it. Just avoid the wood.”

It was easier said than done. One of the planks near to the end was so long that it practically required a jump. Asaba stepped as far as he could, wobbling and reaching out to the wall - but it was smoother than he’d anticipated. Reacting quickly, Miroslav moved forward to steady him by the shoulder. Asaba took his next step and found a nook in the wall to hold onto, but Miroslav’s next step broke the wooden plank in the process.

Asaba was the one to scream as he fell, but Miroslav managed to catch onto the edge with both hands, and he tried to pull himself up - but the walkway was too narrow, even for Asaba to get down and grab him.

It didn’t stop him from trying, and the pain in his torso exploded and burned as he crouched and attempted to grab Miroslav’s wrist.

“Don’t be silly,” Miroslav said - seemingly more bothered by Asaba than his predicament. He unhooked his bag and tossed it up onto the walkway for Asaba to catch.

“What- what?” With the bag secured, Asaba tried to pull him up. “If I move back, can you-”

“Let go of me. I won’t take you down as well.”

“You’re just going to *fall*?” It was a gaping abyss below - too black to work out where the end was. “No. No way. Your mother and your sisters need you.”

“So does your family.”

“Nononono.” Asaba could feel the panic rising in his chest, in his throat - through his shuddering breaths, even through the pain- “Don’t fall, *please*.”

“You expect me to fly, like a sea angel?”

“It’s so far down. You won’t survive.”

“Sure I will.”

*You’re gonna die you’re gonna die please don’t die please*

“I think I really like you,” Asaba blurted out. “I don’t want you to die.”

“No shit.” In the dimly lit gloom, Asaba watched Miroslav’s face finally soften. “You’ve never been in a near death situation before, huh?”

*Please. Please please please.&#x20;*&#x48;is grip was slipping, and there was nothing Asaba could do-

*What am I begging for?*

*…A solution. For something to come in and save him. Because I can’t. I don’t want him to die, but I can’t pull him up-*

“Don’t- can’t you take it seriously?” Asaba pleaded.

“From the moment we met, I knew you were stupid,” Miroslav chuckled. “You were so nonchalant about bleeding out-”

“-but this is *you*. I don’t want to lose *you*.”

Miroslav muttered something under his breath - a curse, judging from the tone of it - and said flatly, “Let go and I’ll date you.”

“But you’ll-”

“No. I owe you money. I’m like a cat - land on my feet with 8 lives to spare.” With a half-smile, he added a deadpan, “Mraow.”

*Please. Please. Please. I don’t want to say goodbye. We only just…*

“Miroslav.” It came out like a gasp.

“Mirek,” he corrected. “Is what my family call me.”

*If he falls, let him live. Let him live. Please, please, please, let him be okay.*

“...See you soon, Mirek.”

“See you, Asaba Tsukaji.”

Asaba lifted his hand and watched Mirek descend into the abyss.

*Dear Themis -I know we haven’t been on very good terms.*

Scraping and tumbling against the cliff on his way down, Mirek managed to slow his fall by grabbing onto something - anything. But he only ended up slipping all over again.

*I’m not exactly the pinnacle of justice and honour, I know. Lying, stealing and leaving people behind… I’m not the type of model citizen you’d offer your blessings to.*

His head was spinning. The darkness was a blur.

*But you have protected my people, and my family. So please also extend your protection to him as well.*

*He deserves it. His honour, his kindness, his strength -*

*“Mama, come home safe. Please.”*

*“Of course. I’ll pray for Themis to be on my side today, and every day.”*

*Whether I die or not, let him live a long and happy life.*

*I beseech you, Themis. I pray for him–*

The cold water hit like stone and enveloped him like ice.

He couldn’t bring his limbs to move from the shock. The fall had knocked the air out of him long before he’d reached the pit.

But the ocean’s surface glowed before him. And as he sank, he could make out a small shoal of candy sea angels. A crimson seafoam jellyfish. A sparse shoal of glassfins. A large, dreamshore jellyfish, its pearlescent white tentacles fading out of vision.

Water filling his throat and lungs.

*This has got to be the strangest thing I’ve caught in my whole life.*

Asaba’s heart was pounding out of his chest as he took the plunge, diving over the edge of his boat and into the icy waters below. The body was freezing cold, soaking wet, and heavy. The wound on his torso screamed at him as he hauled it into the boat.

*CPR, right? Fuck.*

Asaba couldn’t pinpoint why he was trembling - it wasn’t *just* the cold. Sitting the body up against him, he braced his hands together and started compressing at his chest.

*Hasn’t it been too long? I don’t-*

*You’re a liar. A damned selfish liar. I can’t believe I believed-*

Mirek let out a hollow cough, then leaned over the side of the boat to vomit water.

Asaba immediately moved to steady the boat, then grabbed at Mirek’s mostly limp body before he tipped overboard. *Again*.

Mirek cleared his throat, gurgled, then returned to coughing up.

“Take your time,” Asaba sighed, patting him firmly on the back - clearly firm enough to make Mirek jump.

“Where-” he managed after a little more of that.

“Turns out there’s an exit very close to somebody’s favorite pier!” Asaba replied shakily. “A-and I heard you fall into the water, and…”

He was tearing up again. Chest heaving. As Mirek took his first gasps of clear breath, he pulled him into a hug.

“I ran and ran and ran… I’m so glad…”

“Thank you,” Mirek croaked. “...You’re warm.”

“...I sure hope so, after all that.”

Mirek leaned back, smoothed some of Asaba’s wet hair to the side, and planted a kiss on his head. “I’ll keep my promise this time.”

“You- you don’t have to-”

“Nonsense. I think I really like you too. …And besides - we have that membership together now, don’t we?”
